First off: good job on the code!  It's nice and clear, and easy to
follow what it does and what it should do.

* Style

** Spaces

 First off, a small remark about the spacing.  I think it's interesting
 to write pattern matching without a space after the first character
 (=|=), because it looks like some ascii tree if you end the list with
 the "default" matcher (=|_=).  But I would not recommend it,
 especially while the spacing is not really consistent in the file.

 I saw you already reformatted the code on github, which is a good
 thing!  Consistent spacing makes it easier for other programmers to
 read the code and not get distracted.
